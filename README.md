# ui-loadscript-viewer
An extension object for viewing (not editing) a Qlik Sense load script in a published app.

The Load Script Viewer is a simple extension that displays the load script of a Qlik Sense application without having to go into the data load editor.  The extension is read-only and does not allow copying or pasting.  It does **NOT** write back to the load script of an app.  It's meant to give developers an easy way to look at a script without lots of clicks.  And... theming!
